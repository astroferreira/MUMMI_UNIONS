# MUMMI_UNIONS
Merger catalogs from MUMMI (MUlti Model Merger Identifier) on UNIONS r-band images. MUMMI is a hybrid ensemble of deep learning models, including CNNs and SwinTransformers, trained with simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulations. Please refer to the full paper for details.

## Catalog

Provided in this repository is the MUMMI catalog for the footprint of the UNIONS r-band imaging that overlaps with SDSS DR7 spectra. We include the DR7 objIDs and their corresponding RA and DEC coordinates, as well as the number of votes by MUMMI on the merger classification task (0-20), and the probabilities for the merger stage task (0-1). Additionally, we add a column that labels each galaxy in one of the three classes: non-merger (0), pair (1) and post-merger (2) following our recommendation for highest purity using unanimous voting.
